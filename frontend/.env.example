# API URL for the backend server
# This is used for both HTTP API calls and WebSocket connections
# The WebSocket URL will be automatically derived by converting http:// to ws:// (or https:// to wss://)
#
# Examples:
# - Local development: http://localhost:8080
# - Production (HTTP): http://api.example.com
# - Production (HTTPS): https://api.example.com
#
# Note: In Vite, environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_ to be exposed to the client
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
